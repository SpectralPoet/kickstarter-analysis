# An updated analysis of kickstarter campaigns.
UW Data Analysis Bootcamp Module 1 Exercise
*Mock exercise done to help a faux playwright find and examine data on what would create a successful play kickstarter campaign.

*To the mock playwright I would add to launch the campaign in May, and keep the goal between $1,500 and $5,000.

*Also, should anyone not involved with the course look at this, I must deeply apologize for the graphs with perhaps poorly labeled axes. Obviously much less useful,
*but not in the course flow.
